abstract = """Numerous sensors have been deployed in different geospatial locations to continuously and cooperatively monitor the surrounding environment, such as the air quality. These sensors generate multiple geo-sensory time series, with spatial correlations
between their readings. Forecasting geo-sensory time series is of great importance yet very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, i.e., dynamic spatio-temporal correlations and external factors. In this paper, we predict the readings of a geo-sensor over several future hours by using a multi-level attention-based recurrent neural network that considers multiple sensorsâ€™ readings, meteorological data, and spatial data. More specifically, our model consists of two major parts: 1) a multi-level attention mechanism to model the dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies. 2) a general fusion module to incorporate the external factors
from different domains. Experiments on two types of real-world datasets, viz., air quality data and water quality data, demonstrate that our method outperforms nine baseline methods."""
