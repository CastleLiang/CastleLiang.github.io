These sensors generate multiple geo-sensory time series, with spatial correlations\nbetween their readings. Forecasting geo-sensory time series is of great importance yet very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, i.e., dynamic spatio-temporal correlations and external factors. In this paper, we predict the readings of a geo-sensor over several future hours by using a multi-level attention-based recurrent neural network that considers multiple sensorsâ€™ readings, meteorological data, and spatial data. More specifically, our model consists of two major parts: 1) a multi-level attention mechanism to model the dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies. 2) a general fusion module to incorporate the external factors\nfrom different domains. Experiments on two types of real-world datasets, viz., air quality data and water quality data, demonstrate that our method outperforms nine baseline methods.","tags":null,"title":"GeoMAN: Multi-level Attention Networks for Geo-sensory Time Series Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheyi Pan","**Yuxuan Liang**","Junbo Zhang","Xiuwen Yi","Yong Yu","Yu Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"7ed553719c8682979e96dedb7c756214","permalink":"/publication/arxiv-18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arxiv-18/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"HyperST-Net: Hypernetworks for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Yuxuan Liang**","Zhongyuan Jiang","Yu Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509753600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509753600,"objectID":"3e8e691abc293c2b7ed1522bbc310128","permalink":"/publication/gis-17/","publishdate":"2017-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gis-17/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Inferring Traffic Cascading Patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ye Liu","Yu Zheng","**Yuxuan Liang**","Shuming Liu","David S.
