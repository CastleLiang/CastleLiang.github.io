For example, to recommend a\nranked list of hotels, an algorithm needs to learn which hotels are the right price for particular users, as well as how users vary in their weighting of price against the location. In our paper, we formulate the context-aware, multi-objective, ranking problem as a Multi-Objective Contextual Ranked Bandit (MOCR-B). To solve the MOCR-B problem, we present a novel algorithm, named MultiObjective\nUtility-Upper Confidence Bound (MOUUCB). The goal of MOU-UCB is to learn how to generate a ranked list of resources that maximizes\nthe rewards in multiple objectives to give relevant search results. Our algorithm learns to predict rewards in multiple objectives based on contextual information (combining the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm for multi-armed contextual bandits with neural network embeddings), as well as learns how a user weights the multiple objectives. Our empirical results reveal that the ranked\nlists generated by MOU-UCB lead to better clickthrough rates, compared to approaches that do not learn the utility function over multiple reward objectives..","tags":["Multi-armed Bandit"],"title":"Learning Multi-Objective Rewards and User Utility Function in Contextual Bandits for Personalized Ranking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Yuxuan Liang**","Kun Ouyang","Lin Jing","Sijie Ruan","Ye Liu","Junbo Zhang","David S.

However, the ubiquitous deployment of monitoring devices, such as CCTVs, induces a long-lasting and enormous cost for maintenance and operation. This suggests the need for a technology that can reduce the number of deployed devices, while preventing the degeneration of data accuracy and granularity. In this paper, we aim to infer the real-time and fine-grained crowd flows throughout a city based on coarse-grained observations. This task is challenging due to the two essential reasons: the spatial correlations between coarse- and fine-grained urban flows, and the complexities of external impacts. To tackle these issues, we develop a method entitled UrbanFM based on deep neural networks. Our model consists of two major parts: 1) an inference network to generate fine-grained flow distributions from coarse-grained inputs by using a feature extraction module and a novel distributional upsampling module; 2) a general fusion subnet to further boost the performance by considering the influences of different external factors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, namely TaxiBJ and HappyValley, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method compared to seven baselines, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance of our approach on the fine-grained urban flow inference problem.\r\n","tags":["Deep Learning","ST Data","CNN","Super-resolution"],"title":"UrbanFM: Inferring Fine-Grained Urban Flows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheyi Pan","**Yuxuan Liang**","Weifeng Wang","Yong Yu","Yu Zheng","Junbo Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556409600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556409600,"objectID":"9d59c3bdc14299144bc1ab7145cb1e07","permalink":"https://yuxuanliang.com/publication/kdd-19-2/","publishdate":"2019-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kdd-19-2/","section":"publication","summary":"Predicting urban traffic (e.g., flow, speed) is of great importance to intelligent transportation systems and public safety, yet is very challenging as it is affected by two aspects: 1) complex spatio-temporal correlations of urban traffic, including spatial correlations between locations along with temporal correlations among different timestamps; 2) diversity of such spatio-temporal correlations, which vary from location to location and depend on the surrounding geographical information, e.g., points of interests and road networks. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a deep-meta-learning based traffic model, entitled ST-MetaNet, to collectively predict urban traffic in all location at once. ST-MetaNet employs a sequence-to-sequence network architecture, consisting of an encoder to learn historical traffic information and a decoder to make predictions step by step. More specifically, the encoder and decoder have the same network structure, which contains a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode the urban traffic, a meta graph attention network (Meta-GAT) to capture diverse spatial correlations, and a meta recurrent neural network (Meta-RNN) to consider diverse temporal correlations. Extensive experiments were conducted based on two real-world datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of ST-MetaNet against several state-of-the-art methods.\r\n","tags":["Deep Learning","ST Data","Meta Learning"],"title":"Urban Traffic Prediction from Spatio-Temporal Data using Deep Meta Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nirandika Wanigasekara","**Yuxuan Liang**","Joseph J.

Forecasting over ST data is of great importance but challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, including spatial characteristics, temporal characteristics and the intrinsic causality between them. In this paper, we propose a general framework (HyperST-Net) based on hypernetworks for deep ST models. More specifically, it consists of three major modules: a spatial module, a temporal module and a deduction module. Among them, the deduction module derives the parameter weights of the temporal module from the spatial characteristics, which are extracted by the spatial module. Then, we design a general form of HyperST layer as well as different forms for several basic layers in neural networks, including the dense layer (HyperST-Dense) and the convolutional layer (HyperST-Conv).

Traffic cascading patterns are of great importance to easing traffic and improving urban planning. However, what we can observe is individual traffic conditions on different road segments at discrete time intervals, rather than explicit interactions or propagation (e.g., Aâ†’B) between road segments. Additionally, the traffic from multiple sources and the geospatial correlations between road segments make it more challenging to infer the patterns. In this paper, we first model the three-fold influences existing in traffic propagation and then propose a data-driven approach, which finds the cascading patterns through maximizing the likelihood of observed traffic data. As this is equivalent to a submodular function maximization problem, we solve it by using an approximate algorithm with provable near-optimal performance guarantees based on its submodularity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our approach in both effectiveness and efficiency.","tags":["ST Data","Generative"],"title":"Inferring Traffic Cascading Patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ye Liu","Yu Zheng","**Yuxuan Liang**","Shuming Liu","David S.
