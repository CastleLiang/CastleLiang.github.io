A technique is required to reduce the number of deployed devices, while preventing the degeneration of data accuracy and granularity.

This task exhibits two challenges: the spatial correlations between coarse-and fine-grained urban flows, and the complexities of external impacts. To tackle these issues, we develop a model entitled UrbanFM which consists of two major parts: 1) an inference network to generate fine-grained flow distributions from coarse-grained inputs that uses a feature extraction module and a novel distributional upsampling module; 2) a general fusion subnet to further boost the performance by considering the influence of different external factors. This structure provides outstanding effectiveness and efficiency for small scale upsampling. However, the single-pass upsampling used by UrbanFM is insufficient at higher upscaling rates. Therefore, we further present UrbanPy, a cascading model for progressive inference of fine-grained urban flows by decomposing the original tasks into multiple subtasks. Compared to UrbanFM, such an enhanced structure demonstrates favorable performance for larger-scale inference tasks.","tags":["Deep Learning","ST Data","CNN","Super-resolution"],"title":"Fine-Grained Urban Flow Inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junkai Sun","Junbo Zhang","Qiaofei Li","Xiuwen Yi","**Yuxuan Liang**","Yu Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594598400,"objectID":"74de5b4f86358fec8f82c6caa224c200","permalink":"https://yuxuanliang.com/publication/tkde-20-2/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tkde-20-2/","section":"publication","summary":"Being able to predict the crowd flows in each and every part of a city, especially in irregular regions, is strategically\r\nimportant for traffic control, risk assessment, and public safety.

Fortunately, with the development of unmanned vehicles, the dynamic allocation of those public resources becomes possible. To this end, we provide the frst attempt to design an effective and efcient scheduling algorithm for the dynamic public resource allocation. We formulate the problem as a novel multi-agent long-term maximal coverage scheduling (MALMCS) problem, which considers the crowd coverage and the energy limitation during a whole day. Two main components are employed in the system: 1) multi-step crowd ﬂow prediction, which makes multi-step crowd ﬂow prediction given the current crowd ﬂows and external factors; and 2) energy adaptive scheduling, which employs a two-step heuristic algorithm, i.e., energy adaptive scheduling (EADS), to generate a scheduling plan that maximizes the crowd coverage within the service time for agents.
